#### Communication Flow

a. Configuration and Control:
Users configure the parameters (Name, Location, color, brightness, on time, off time) of the smart light bulbs through the user applications.
The applications send MQTT messages to the backend server, which updates the respective light bulb's configuration.
The backend server forwards the configuration updates to the Zigbee gateway in MQTT format.
The gateway translates the MQTT messages to Zigbee protocol and communicates with the corresponding light bulb to apply the configuration changes.

b. Physical Button Interaction:
When the physical button on a light bulb is pressed, the bulb sends a Zigbee message to the Zigbee gateway indicating the state change.
The gateway converts the Zigbee message to MQTT format and forwards it to the backend server.
The server updates the state of the respective light bulb and sends notifications to the user applications via MQTT, indicating the state change.

c. User Access and Sharing:
The backend server manages user authentication and authorization using an IAM system.
Users can share access to specific light bulbs with others through the applications.
The server updates the access permissions, and notifications are sent to the invited users via MQTT.
Invited users can control and configure the shared light bulbs through their authorized user applications.

## Functionalities

1. Time-based Modes:

   - The smart light bulb can have different modes based on the time of day, such as Morning, Daytime, Evening, and Night.
   - Each mode corresponds to a specific lighting configuration suitable for that time period.
   - Implementation Methodology:
     - The backend server can schedule mode changes based on predefined time ranges.
     - The smart light bulb receives the mode change command via MQTT and adjusts its color, brightness, and other parameters accordingly.

2. Motion Sensor Mode:

   - When the motion sensor detects activity in the area, the smart light bulb can automatically turn on.
   - This feature ensures that the light is only activated when someone is present in the vicinity.
   - Implementation Methodology:
     - The motion sensor sends a signal to the smart light bulb or the backend server upon detecting motion.
     - The smart light bulb receives the motion detection command and turns on or adjusts its state accordingly.

3. Light Sensor Mode:

   - The light sensor can be utilized to adjust the brightness of the smart light bulb based on the ambient light level.
   - When the surrounding light is dim, the bulb can increase its brightness, and when the light is

bright, it can lower its brightness or turn off.

- Implementation Methodology:
  - The light sensor continuously measures the ambient light level.
  - The smart light bulb or the backend server receives the light sensor data and adjusts the bulb's brightness accordingly.

4. Environment-based Sensors:

   - Additional environment-based sensors like temperature, humidity, or air quality sensors can be integrated with the smart light bulb.
   - These sensors provide data about the surrounding environment, allowing the light bulb to respond accordingly.
   - For example, if the temperature exceeds a certain threshold, the light bulb can change its color to indicate a warning.
   - Implementation Methodology:
     - Environment sensors collect relevant data and send it to the smart light bulb or the backend server.
     - The light bulb or the server analyzes the sensor data and triggers appropriate actions or changes in the bulb's behavior.

5. Mood-based Modes:
   - The smart light bulb can have pre-defined or customizable modes based on different moods or atmospheres, such as Relaxing, Energizing, or Romantic.
   - Each mode corresponds to a unique combination of colors, brightness levels, and effects to create a desired ambiance.
   - Implementation Methodology:
     - The user selects the desired mood mode from the application.
     - The backend server sends the mode configuration to the smart light bulb via MQTT, adjusting its parameters accordingly.

The implementation of these functionalities requires coordination between the smart light bulb, surrounding sensors, Zigbee gateway, and backend server. The sensors gather data, which is then processed by the backend server and communicated to the smart light bulb through the Zigbee gateway using MQTT. The light bulb reacts to the received commands, adjusting its state, color, brightness, and other parameters based on the specified modes and sensor inputs. This implementation allows for dynamic and automated control of the smart light bulb, enhancing user experience and energy efficiency in various scenarios.

The implementation of these features requires the following steps:

1. Integration of appropriate sensors with the smart bulb or gateway.
2. Development of firmware or software logic to interpret sensor data and trigger corresponding actions.
3. Configuration options in the user applications to customize settings and modes.
4. MQTT communication between the user applications, backend server, and smart bulbs for seamless synchronization and control.
5. Testing and refinement of the implemented features to ensure accuracy and reliability.

By incorporating these functionalities, the smart bulb system becomes more versatile, adaptable, and user-friendly, offering an enhanced lighting experience that caters to various scenarios, user preferences, and environmental conditions.
