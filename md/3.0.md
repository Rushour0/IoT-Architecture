## Technical stack combinations for the development

1. LoRaWAN + MQTT + AWS IoT + Cloud Storage:

   - LoRaWAN for long-range, low-power wireless communication.
   - MQTT as the messaging protocol for lightweight communication.
   - AWS IoT for device management, data processing, and analytics.
   - Cloud storage for storing and retrieving IoT data.

2. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) + MQTT + Azure IoT + Edge Computing:

   - BLE for short-range communication with low power consumption.
   - MQTT for efficient and reliable messaging.
   - Azure IoT for device management, data processing, and edge computing capabilities.
   - Edge computing to perform real-time analytics and decision-making at the network edge.

3. Thread + CoAP + Google Cloud IoT + Cloud Functions:

   - Thread as a low-power, mesh networking protocol for IoT devices.
   - CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) for resource-constrained devices and efficient communication.
   - Google Cloud IoT for device registration, management, and integration with Google Cloud services.
   - Cloud Functions to trigger serverless functions and perform actions based on IoT data.

4. NB-IoT + MQTT + IBM Watson IoT Platform + Blockchain ( not low cost ):

   - NB-IoT (Narrowband IoT) for wide-area coverage and low-power communication.
   - MQTT for lightweight messaging between devices and the cloud.
   - IBM Watson IoT Platform for device management, data visualization, and analytics.
   - Blockchain for secure and transparent transaction recording and smart contract execution.
